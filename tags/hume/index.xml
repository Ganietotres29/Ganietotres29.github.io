      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, it seems to be reliable to the statements as following. If having observed decades of lions that eat meat, we may readily infer that all the lions eat meat. If already heeding that some leaves on trees fall down when the wind flaps each time, we would also hold that the leaves will fall down if the wind flaps again. If all experiments under the same condition we have made bring out one single result that a ball moves forward after a stick hits it, we seem to obtain a regular pattern as well that the balls will move forward afresh once it is struck by the stick in the equal test afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first foregoing case, we may apply an inferential method called induction which roughly says that the observations could be justified for the empirical similarities that are unobserved. In the second and third descriptions, we seem to use a causal inference way called causation which plausibly establishes a relation between the cause and the effect. It seems to be quite obvious and normal for us to believe that those theories are true and thus many opinions formulated from life are based on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
